 * 
 *  Elementary data structures.  Explain how to use a priority queue to implement 
 *  the stack, queue, and randomized queue data types from Chapter 1.
 *  
 *  
 *  Priority queue maintains some priority order, in the case of stack and queues, this order must "the time of addition".
 *  We are using compareTo() method and we must integrate this logic inside this method. 
 *  
 *  For stack, we must have max priority queue where the last added item will be at the root.
 *  
 *  For queue, we must have min priority queue where the first added item will be at the root.
