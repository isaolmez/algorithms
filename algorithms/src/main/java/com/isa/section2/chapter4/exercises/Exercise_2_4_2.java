 * 
 * Q: Criticize the following idea: To implement ﬁnd the maximum in constant time, 
 * why not use a stack or a queue, but keep track of the maximum value inserted so far,
 * then return that value for ﬁnd the maximum?
 * 
 * A: Although insert may take constant time by using stack or queue(especially when using linked-lists as data structure), finding maximum is not so easy.
 * Storing the maximum (so far) guarantees that returning the max first time will be constant, but consuquent calls will take linear time (traversing the whole)
