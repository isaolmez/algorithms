/***
 * 
 * Q: Is an array that is sorted in decreasing order a max-oriented heap?
 * 
 * 
 * A: Yes, but not all heaps are in decreasing order. 
 * 
 * Heap is array representation of heap-ordered binary tree. It must satisfy following condition.
 * Index [k] is larger than [2*k] and [2*k+1]. And vice versa. Following this property we can have [k+1] be smaller than [k] and also smaller than [2*k] or [2*k+1].
